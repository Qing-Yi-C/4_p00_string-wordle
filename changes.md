## Changes:
* Reset button to reset game (suggestion made in AprilJangster's raised issue). We are thinking of using the space bar
* Getting rid of Player class. We can do player positon in the tile class. Thinking of a keyboard class?
* Splitting pos instance variable in the tile class into xpos and ypos
* setColor will be done in driver file instead of tile class
* setChar will also be done in driver file
* insert method in tile class (insert typed characters)
